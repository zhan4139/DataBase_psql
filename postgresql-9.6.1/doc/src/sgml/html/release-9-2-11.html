      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.

      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <TT

      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check
      finally occurred, even if the row(s) the new row originally conflicted

     </P
><P
>      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT

      thing to do in minor releases.)

>      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input

      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <TT

      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
