>    When the optimizer determines that parallel query is the fastest execution
    strategy for a particular query, it will create a query plan which includes
    a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Gather node</I
>.  Here is a simple example:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE filler LIKE '%x%';
                                     QUERY PLAN                                      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2
   -&#62;  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (filler ~~ '%x%'::text)
(4 rows)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    In all cases, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node will have exactly one
    child plan, which is the portion of the plan that will be executed in
    parallel.  If the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node is at the very top of the plan
    tree, then the entire query will execute in parallel.  If it is somewhere
    else in the plan tree, then only that portion of the query will run in
    parallel.  In the example above, the query accesses only one table, so
    there is only one plan node other than the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node itself;
    since that plan node is a child of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node, it will
    run in parallel.
   </P
><P
>    <A
HREF="using-explain.html"
>Using EXPLAIN</A
>, you can see the number of
    workers chosen by the planner.  When the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node is reached
    during query execution, the process which is implementing the user's
    session will request a number of <A
HREF="bgworker.html"
>background
    worker processes</A
> equal to the number
    of workers chosen by the planner.  The total number of background
    workers that can exist at any one time is limited by
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-WORKER-PROCESSES"
>max_worker_processes</A
>, so it is possible for a
    parallel query to run with fewer workers than planned, or even with
    no workers at all.  The optimal plan may depend on the number of workers
    that are available, so this can result in poor query performance.  If this
    occurrence is frequent, considering increasing
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_worker_processes</TT
> so that more workers can be run
    simultaneously or alternatively reducing
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-PER-GATHER"
>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</A
> so that the planner
    requests fewer workers.
   </P
><P
>    Every background worker process which is successfully started for a given
    parallel query will execute the portion of the plan which is a descendent
    of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node.  The leader will also execute that portion
    of the plan, but it has an additional responsibility: it must also read
    all of the tuples generated by the workers.  When the parallel portion of
    the plan generates only a small number of tuples, the leader will often
    behave very much like an additional worker, speeding up query execution.
    Conversely, when the parallel portion of the plan generates a large number
    of tuples, the leader may be almost entirely occupied with reading the
    tuples generated by the workers and performing any further processing
    steps which are required by plan nodes above the level of the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Gather</TT
> node.  In such cases, the leader will do very
    little of the work of executing the parallel portion of the plan.
