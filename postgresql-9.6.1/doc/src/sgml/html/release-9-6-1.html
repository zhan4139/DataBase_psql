>      Fix WAL-logging of truncation of relation free space maps and
      visibility maps (Pavan Deolasee, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      It was possible for these files to not be correctly restored during
      crash recovery, or to be written incorrectly on a standby server.
      Bogus entries in a free space map could lead to attempts to access
      pages that have been truncated away from the relation itself, typically
      producing errors like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"could not read block <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>XXX</I
></TT
>:
      read only 0 of 8192 bytes"</SPAN
>.  Checksum failures in the
      visibility map are also possible, if checksumming is enabled.
     </P
><P
>      Procedures for determining whether there is a problem and repairing it
      if so are discussed at
      <A

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> rewrites
      a relation visibility map into 9.6 format (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      On big-endian machines, bytes of the new visibility map were written
      in the wrong order, leading to a completely incorrect map.  On
      Windows, the old map was read using text mode, leading to incorrect
      results if the map happened to contain consecutive bytes that matched
      a carriage return/line feed sequence.  The latter error would almost
      always lead to a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> failure due to the map
      file appearing to be the wrong length.
     </P
><P
>      If you are using a big-endian machine (many non-Intel architectures
      are big-endian) and have used <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> to upgrade
      from a pre-9.6 release, you should assume that all visibility maps are
      incorrect and need to be regenerated.  It is sufficient to truncate
      each relation's visibility map

      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <SPAN
