      This avoids unexpected failures when IANA removes abbreviations from
      their time zone database, as they did in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tzdata</SPAN
>
      release 2016f and seem likely to do again in the future.  The
      consequences were not limited to not recognizing the individual
      abbreviation; any mismatch caused
      the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_timezone_abbrevs</TT
> view to fail altogether.

><P
>      Update time zone data files to <SPAN

      for DST law changes in Palestine and Turkey, plus historical
      corrections for Turkey and some regions of Russia.
      Switch to numeric abbreviations for some time zones in Antarctica,
      the former Soviet Union, and Sri Lanka.
     </P
><P
>      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.
      But they will not be shown in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_timezone_names</TT
>
      view nor used for output.
     </P
><P
>      In this update, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>AMT</TT
> is no longer shown as being in use to
      mean Armenia Time.  Therefore, we have changed the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Default</TT
>
      abbreviation set to interpret it as Amazon Time, thus UTC-4 not UTC+4.
