   generally assumes that immutable built-in functions and operators are

>   Here is an example of creating a foreign table with
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>postgres_fdw</TT
>. First install the extension:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;</PRE
><P
>   Then create a foreign server using <A
HREF="sql-createserver.html"
>CREATE SERVER</A
>.
   In this example we wish to connect to a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server
   on host <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.83.123.89</TT
> listening on
   port <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5432</TT
>.  The database to which the connection is made
   is named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foreign_db</TT
> on the remote server:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE SERVER foreign_server
        FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
        OPTIONS (host '192.83.123.89', port '5432', dbname 'foreign_db');</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   A user mapping, defined with <A
HREF="sql-createusermapping.html"
>CREATE USER MAPPING</A
>, is
   needed as well to identify the role that will be used on the remote
   server:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE USER MAPPING FOR local_user
        SERVER foreign_server
        OPTIONS (user 'foreign_user', password 'password');</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Now it is possible to create a foreign table with
   <A
HREF="sql-createforeigntable.html"
>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</A
>.  In this example we
   wish to access the table named <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>some_schema.some_table</TT
>
   on the remote server.  The local name for it will
   be <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>foreign_table</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_table (
        id integer NOT NULL,
        data text
)
        SERVER foreign_server
        OPTIONS (schema_name 'some_schema', table_name 'some_table');</PRE
><P>

   It's essential that the data types and other properties of the columns
   declared in <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</TT
> match the actual remote table.
   Column names must match as well, unless you attach <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>column_name</TT
>
   options to the individual columns to show how they are named in the remote
   table.
   In many cases, use of <A
HREF="sql-importforeignschema.html"
>IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA</A
> is
   preferable to constructing foreign table definitions manually.
