></H1
><P
>   Because roles can own database objects and can hold privileges
   to access other objects, dropping a role is often not just a matter of a
   quick <A
HREF="sql-droprole.html"
>DROP ROLE</A
>.  Any objects owned by the role must
   first be dropped or reassigned to other owners; and any permissions
   granted to the role must be revoked.
  </P
><P
>   Ownership of objects can be transferred one at a time
   using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER</TT
> commands, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ALTER TABLE bobs_table OWNER TO alice;</PRE
><P>
   Alternatively, the <A
HREF="sql-reassign-owned.html"
>REASSIGN OWNED</A
> command can be
   used to reassign ownership of all objects owned by the role-to-be-dropped
   to a single other role.  Because <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REASSIGN OWNED</TT
> cannot access
   objects in other databases, it is necessary to run it in each database
   that contains objects owned by the role.  (Note that the first
   such <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REASSIGN OWNED</TT
> will change the ownership of any
   shared-across-databases objects, that is databases or tablespaces, that
   are owned by the role-to-be-dropped.)
  </P
><P
>   Once any valuable objects have been transferred to new owners, any
   remaining objects owned by the role-to-be-dropped can be dropped with
   the <A
HREF="sql-drop-owned.html"
>DROP OWNED</A
> command.  Again, this command cannot
   access objects in other databases, so it is necessary to run it in each
   database that contains objects owned by the role.  Also, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP
   OWNED</TT
> will not drop entire databases or tablespaces, so it is
   necessary to do that manually if the role owns any databases or
   tablespaces that have not been transferred to new owners.
  </P
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP OWNED</TT
> also takes care of removing any privileges granted
   to the target role for objects that do not belong to it.
   Because <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REASSIGN OWNED</TT
> does not touch such objects, it's
   typically necessary to run both <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REASSIGN OWNED</TT
>
   and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP OWNED</TT
> (in that order!) to fully remove the
   dependencies of a role to be dropped.
  </P
><P
>   In short then, the most general recipe for removing a role that has been
   used to own objects is:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>REASSIGN OWNED BY doomed_role TO successor_role;
DROP OWNED BY doomed_role;
-- repeat the above commands in each database of the cluster
DROP ROLE doomed_role;</PRE
><P
>   When not all owned objects are to be transferred to the same successor
   owner, it's best to handle the exceptions manually and then perform
   the above steps to mop up.
  </P
><P
>   If <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP ROLE</TT
> is attempted while dependent objects still
   remain, it will issue messages identifying which objects need to be
   reassigned or dropped.
  </P
