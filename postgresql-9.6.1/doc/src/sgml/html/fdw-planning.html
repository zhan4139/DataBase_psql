>     The information in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"

     to reduce the amount of information that has to be fetched from the
     foreign table (and therefore reduce the cost).
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</TT
> is particularly interesting, as
     it contains restriction quals (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clauses) that should be
     used to filter the rows to be fetched.  (The FDW itself is not required
     to enforce these quals, as the core executor can check them instead.)
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;reltarget-&gt;exprs</TT
> can be used to determine which
     columns need to be fetched; but note that it only lists columns that
     have to be emitted by the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignScan</TT
> plan node, not
     columns that are used in qual evaluation but not output by the query.
    </P
><P
>     Various private fields are available for the FDW planning functions to
     keep information in.  Generally, whatever you store in FDW private fields
     should be palloc'd, so that it will be reclaimed at the end of planning.
    </P
><P
>     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;fdw_private</TT
> is a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>void</TT
> pointer that is
     available for FDW planning functions to store information relevant to
     the particular foreign table.  The core planner does not touch it except
     to initialize it to NULL when the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RelOptInfo</TT
> node is created.
     It is useful for passing information forward from
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignRelSize</CODE
> to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPaths</CODE
> and/or
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPaths</CODE

CLASS="FUNCTION"

     avoiding recalculation.
    </P
><P
>     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPaths</CODE

     access paths by storing private information in the
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> field of <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

> nodes.
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> is declared as a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>List</TT
> pointer, but
     could actually contain anything since the core planner does not touch
     it.  However, best practice is to use a representation that's dumpable
     by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>nodeToString</CODE
>, for use with debugging support available
     in the backend.
    </P
><P
>     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
> can examine the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
>
     field of the selected <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignPath</TT
> node, and can generate
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_exprs</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> lists to be
     placed in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignScan</TT
> plan node, where they will be
     available at execution time.  Both of these lists must be
     represented in a form that <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>copyObject</CODE
> knows how to copy.
     The <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> list has no other restrictions and is
     not interpreted by the core backend in any way.  The
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_exprs</TT
> list, if not NIL, is expected to contain
     expression trees that are intended to be executed at run time.  These
     trees will undergo post-processing by the planner to make them fully
     executable.
    </P
><P
>     In <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
>, generally the passed-in target list can
     be copied into the plan node as-is.  The passed <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>scan_clauses</TT
> list
     contains the same clauses as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</TT
>,
     but may be re-ordered for better execution efficiency.  In simple cases
     the FDW can just strip <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>RestrictInfo</TT
> nodes from the
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>scan_clauses</TT
> list (using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>extract_actual_clauses</CODE
>) and put
     all the clauses into the plan node's qual list, which means that all the
     clauses will be checked by the executor at run time.  More complex FDWs
     may be able to check some of the clauses internally, in which case those
     clauses can be removed from the plan node's qual list so that the
     executor doesn't waste time rechecking them.
    </P
><P
>     As an example, the FDW might identify some restriction clauses of the
     form <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>foreign_variable</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
>
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>sub_expression</I
></TT
>, which it determines can be executed on
     the remote server given the locally-evaluated value of the
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>sub_expression</I
></TT
>.  The actual identification of such a
     clause should happen during <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPaths</CODE
>, since it would
     affect the cost estimate for the path.  The path's
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> field would probably include a pointer to
     the identified clause's <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>RestrictInfo</TT
> node.  Then
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
> would remove that clause from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>scan_clauses</TT
>,
     but add the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>sub_expression</I
></TT
> to <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_exprs</TT
>
     to ensure that it gets massaged into executable form.  It would probably
     also put control information into the plan node's
     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_private</TT
> field to tell the execution functions what
     to do at run time.  The query transmitted to the remote server would
     involve something like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>foreign_variable</I
></TT
> =
     $1</TT
>, with the parameter value obtained at run time from
     evaluation of the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_exprs</TT
> expression tree.
    </P
><P
>     Any clauses removed from the plan node's qual list must instead be added
     to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fdw_recheck_quals</TT
> or rechecked by
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RecheckForeignScan</TT
> in order to ensure correct behavior
     at the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>READ COMMITTED</TT
> isolation level.  When a concurrent
     update occurs for some other table involved in the query, the executor
     may need to verify that all of the original quals are still satisfied for
     the tuple, possibly against a different set of parameter values.  Using
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fdw_recheck_quals</TT
> is typically easier than implementing checks
     inside <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RecheckForeignScan</TT
>, but this method will be
     insufficient when outer joins have been pushed down, since the join tuples
     in that case might have some fields go to NULL without rejecting the
     tuple entirely.
    </P
><P
>     Another <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignScan</TT
> field that can be filled by FDWs
     is <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_scan_tlist</TT
>, which describes the tuples returned by
     the FDW for this plan node.  For simple foreign table scans this can be
     set to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NIL</TT
>, implying that the returned tuples have the
     row type declared for the foreign table.  A non-<TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>NIL</TT
> value must be a
     target list (list of <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>TargetEntry</TT
>s) containing Vars and/or
     expressions representing the returned columns.  This might be used, for
     example, to show that the FDW has omitted some columns that it noticed
     won't be needed for the query.  Also, if the FDW can compute expressions
     used by the query more cheaply than can be done locally, it could add
     those expressions to <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_scan_tlist</TT
>.  Note that join
     plans (created from paths made by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignJoinPaths</CODE
>) must
     always supply <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_scan_tlist</TT
> to describe the set of
     columns they will return.
    </P
><P
>     The FDW should always construct at least one path that depends only on
     the table's restriction clauses.  In join queries, it might also choose
     to construct path(s) that depend on join clauses, for example
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>foreign_variable</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
>
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>local_variable</I
></TT
>.  Such clauses will not be found in
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;baserestrictinfo</TT
> but must be sought in the
     relation's join lists.  A path using such a clause is called a
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"parameterized path"</SPAN
>.  It must identify the other relations
     used in the selected join clause(s) with a suitable value of
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>param_info</TT
>; use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>get_baserel_parampathinfo</CODE
>
     to compute that value.  In <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
>, the
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>local_variable</I
></TT
> portion of the join clause would be added
     to <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_exprs</TT
>, and then at run time the case works the
     same as for an ordinary restriction clause.
    </P
><P
>     If an FDW supports remote joins, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignJoinPaths</CODE
> should
     produce <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignPath</TT
>s for potential remote joins in much
     the same way as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPaths</CODE
> works for base tables.
     Information about the intended join can be passed forward
     to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
> in the same ways described above.
     However, <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>baserestrictinfo</TT
> is not relevant for join
     relations; instead, the relevant join clauses for a particular join are
     passed to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignJoinPaths</CODE

     (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>extra-&gt;restrictlist</TT

    </P
><P
>     An FDW might additionally support direct execution of some plan actions
     that are above the level of scans and joins, such as grouping or
     aggregation.  To offer such options, the FDW should generate paths and
     insert them into the appropriate <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>upper relation</I
>.  For
     example, a path representing remote aggregation should be inserted into
     the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPPERREL_GROUP_AGG</TT
> relation, using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>add_path</CODE
>.
     This path will be compared on a cost basis with local aggregation
     performed by reading a simple scan path for the foreign relation (note
     that such a path must also be supplied, else there will be an error at
     plan time).  If the remote-aggregation path wins, which it usually would,
     it will be converted into a plan in the usual way, by
     calling <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignPlan</CODE
>.  The recommended place to generate
     such paths is in the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GetForeignUpperPaths</CODE
>
     callback function, which is called for each upper relation (i.e., each
     post-scan/join processing step), if all the base relations of the query
     come from the same FDW.
    </P
><P
>     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PlanForeignModify</CODE
> and the other callbacks described in
     <A
HREF="fdw-callbacks.html#FDW-CALLBACKS-UPDATE"
>Section 55.2.4</A
> are designed around the assumption
     that the foreign relation will be scanned in the usual way and then
     individual row updates will be driven by a local <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ModifyTable</TT
>
     plan node.  This approach is necessary for the general case where an
     update requires reading local tables as well as foreign tables.
     However, if the operation could be executed entirely by the foreign
     server, the FDW could generate a path representing that and insert it
     into the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPPERREL_FINAL</TT
> upper relation, where it would
     compete against the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ModifyTable</TT
> approach.  This approach
     could also be used to implement remote <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT FOR UPDATE</TT

     rather than using the row locking callbacks described in
     <A
HREF="fdw-callbacks.html#FDW-CALLBACKS-ROW-LOCKING"
>Section 55.2.5</A
>.  Keep in mind that a path
     inserted into <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPPERREL_FINAL</TT

     implementing <SPAN

     <CODE
