>      Fix WAL-logging of truncation of relation free space maps and
      visibility maps (Pavan Deolasee, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      It was possible for these files to not be correctly restored during
      crash recovery, or to be written incorrectly on a standby server.
      Bogus entries in a free space map could lead to attempts to access
      pages that have been truncated away from the relation itself, typically
      producing errors like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"could not read block <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>XXX</I
></TT
>:
      read only 0 of 8192 bytes"</SPAN
>.  Checksum failures in the
      visibility map are also possible, if checksumming is enabled.
