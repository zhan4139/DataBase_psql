      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
      the <CODE

      affected core <SPAN

      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.

      <SPAN

>      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      (Stephen Frost)
     </P

      a constraint, such as a unique constraint.  If the user does not have
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
> privilege on all columns of the table, this could
      mean exposing values that the user should not be able to see.  Adjust
      the code so that values are displayed only when they came from the SQL
      command or could be selected by the user.

     </P
><P
>      Previously, the JSON Unicode escape <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
> was accepted
      and was stored as those six characters; but that is indistinguishable
      from what is stored for the input <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\\u0000</TT
>, resulting in
      ambiguity.  Moreover, in cases where de-escaped textual output is
      expected, such as the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-&gt;&gt;</TT
> operator, the sequence was
      printed as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
>, which does not meet the expectation
      that JSON escaping would be removed.  (Consistent behavior would
      require emitting a zero byte, but <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> does not
      support zero bytes embedded in text strings.)  9.4.0 included an
      ill-advised attempt to improve this situation by adjusting JSON output
      conversion rules; but of course that could not fix the fundamental
      ambiguity, and it turned out to break other usages of Unicode escape
      sequences.  Revert that, and to avoid the core problem,
      reject <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>jsonb</TT
> input.
     </P
><P
>      If a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>jsonb</TT
> column contains a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
> value stored
      with 9.4.0, it will henceforth read out as though it
      were <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\\u0000</TT
>, which is the other valid interpretation of
      the data stored by 9.4.0 for this case.
     </P
><P
>      The <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>json</TT
> type did not have the storage-ambiguity problem, but
      it did have the problem of inconsistent de-escaped textual output.
      Therefore <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
> will now also be rejected
      in <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>json</TT
> values when conversion to de-escaped form is
      required.  This change does not break the ability to
      store <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\u0000</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>json</TT
> columns so long as no
      processing is done on the values.  This is exactly parallel to the
      cases in which non-ASCII Unicode escapes are allowed when the database
      encoding is not UTF8.
