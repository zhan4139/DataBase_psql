      sub-objects at the same nesting level, for example an array containing
      both scalars and sub-arrays, key hash values could be calculated
      differently than they would be for the same key in a different context.
      This could result in queries not finding entries that they should find.
      Fixing this means that existing indexes may now be inconsistent with the
      new hash calculation code.  Users
