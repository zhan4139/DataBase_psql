        The query writes any data or locks any database rows. If a query
        contains a data-modifying operation either at the top level or within
        a CTE, no parallel plans for that query will be generated. This is a
        limitation of the current implementation which could be lifted in a
        future release.

>        The query might be suspended during execution. In any situation in
        which the system thinks that partial or incremental execution might
        occur, no parallel plan is generated. For example, a cursor created
        using <A
HREF="sql-declare.html"
>DECLARE CURSOR</A

        a parallel plan. Similarly, a PL/pgsql loop of the form
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FOR x IN query LOOP .. END LOOP</TT

        parallel plan, because the parallel query system is unable to verify

        active.

        For example, if a function called by a parallel query issues an SQL
        query itself, that query will never use a parallel plan. This is a
        limitation of the current implementation, but it may not be desirable
        to remove this limitation, since it could result in a single query
        using a very large number of processes.

        The client sends an Execute message with a non-zero fetch count.
        See the discussion of the

        Since <A
HREF="libpq.html"
>libpq</A

        send such a message, this can only occur when using a client that
        does not rely on libpq.  If this is a frequent

        <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-PER-GATHER"
>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</A

        where it is likely, so as to avoid generating query plans that may
        be suboptimal when run serially.

        The transaction isolation level is serializable.  This situation
        does not normally arise, because parallel query plans are not
        generated when the transaction isolation level is serializable.
        However, it can happen if the transaction isolation level is changed to
        serializable after the plan is generated and before it is executed.
