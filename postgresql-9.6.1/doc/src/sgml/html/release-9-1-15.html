>      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after
      an error
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.

      never changes in the usage of any particular locale.  However this
      assumption fails in the real world, so introduce the ability for a
      zone abbreviation to represent a UTC offset that sometimes changes.
      Update the zone abbreviation definition files to make use of this
      feature in timezone locales that have changed the UTC offset of their
      abbreviations since 1970 (according to the IANA timezone database).
      In such timezones, <SPAN

      correct UTC offset with the abbreviation depending on the given date.
