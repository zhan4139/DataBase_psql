>This section provides an overview of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> (The
Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique).</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses a fixed page size (commonly
8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages.  Therefore, it is
not possible to store very large field values directly.  To overcome
this limitation, large field values are compressed and/or broken up into
multiple physical rows.  This happens transparently to the user, with only
small impact on most of the backend code.  The technique is affectionately
known as <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the best thing since sliced bread"</SPAN
>).
The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> infrastructure is also used to improve handling of
large data values in-memory.</P
><P
>Only certain data types support <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> &mdash; there is no need to
impose the overhead on data types that cannot produce large field values.
To support <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>, a data type must have a variable-length
(<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>varlena</I
>) representation, in which, ordinarily, the first
four-byte word of any stored value contains the total length of the value in
bytes (including itself).  <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> does not constrain the rest
of the data type's representation.  The special representations collectively
called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>ed values</I
> work by modifying or
reinterpreting this initial length word.  Therefore, the C-level functions
supporting a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>-able data type must be careful about how they
handle potentially <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>ed input values: an input might not
actually consist of a four-byte length word and contents until after it's
been <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>detoasted</I
>.  (This is normally done by invoking
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM</CODE
> before doing anything with an input value,
but in some cases more efficient approaches are possible.
See <A
HREF="xtypes.html#XTYPES-TOAST"
>Section 36.11.1</A
> for more detail.)</P
><P
><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> usurps two bits of the varlena length word (the high-order
bits on big-endian machines, the low-order bits on little-endian machines),
thereby limiting the logical size of any value of a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>-able
data type to 1 GB (2<SUP
>30</SUP
> - 1 bytes).  When both bits are zero,
the value is an ordinary un-<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>ed value of the data type, and
the remaining bits of the length word give the total datum size (including
length word) in bytes.  When the highest-order or lowest-order bit is set,
the value has only a single-byte header instead of the normal four-byte
header, and the remaining bits of that byte give the total datum size
(including length byte) in bytes.  This alternative supports space-efficient
storage of values shorter than 127 bytes, while still allowing the data type
to grow to 1 GB at need.  Values with single-byte headers aren't aligned on
any particular boundary, whereas values with four-byte headers are aligned on
at least a four-byte boundary; this omission of alignment padding provides
additional space savings that is significant compared to short values.
As a special case, if the remaining bits of a single-byte header are all
zero (which would be impossible for a self-inclusive length), the value is
a pointer to out-of-line data, with several possible alternatives as
described below.  The type and size of such a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>TOAST pointer</I
>
are determined by a code stored in the second byte of the datum.
Lastly, when the highest-order or lowest-order bit is clear but the adjacent
bit is set, the content of the datum has been compressed and must be
decompressed before use.  In this case the remaining bits of the four-byte
length word give the total size of the compressed datum, not the
original data.  Note that compression is also possible for out-of-line data
but the varlena header does not tell whether it has occurred &mdash;
the content of the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer tells that, instead.</P
><P
>As mentioned, there are multiple types of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer datums.
The oldest and most common type is a pointer to out-of-line data stored in
a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> table</I
> that is separate from, but
associated with, the table containing the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer datum
itself.  These <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>on-disk</I
> pointer datums are created by the
<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> management code (in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>access/heap/tuptoaster.c</TT
>)
when a tuple to be stored on disk is too large to be stored as-is.
Further details appear in <A
HREF="storage-toast.html#STORAGE-TOAST-ONDISK"
>Section 65.2.1</A
>.
Alternatively, a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer datum can contain a pointer to
out-of-line data that appears elsewhere in memory.  Such datums are
necessarily short-lived, and will never appear on-disk, but they are very
useful for avoiding copying and redundant processing of large data values.
Further details appear in <A

data is a fairly simple and very fast member

logical datum size (original uncompressed data length) and physical stored size
(different if compression was applied).  Allowing for the varlena header bytes,
the total size of an on-disk <ACRONYM

Each <ACRONYM

with <TT

><P
>This scheme has a number of advantages compared to a more straightforward
approach such as allowing row values to span pages.  Assuming that queries are
usually qualified by comparisons against relatively small key values, most of
the work of the executor will be done using the main row entry. The big values
of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>ed attributes will only be pulled out (if selected at all)
at the time the result set is sent to the client. Thus, the main table is much
smaller and more of its rows fit in the shared buffer cache than would be the
case without any out-of-line storage. Sort sets shrink also, and sorts will
more often be done entirely in memory. A little test showed that a table
containing typical HTML pages and their URLs was stored in about half of the
raw data size including the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> table, and that the main table
contained only about 10% of the entire data (the URLs and some small HTML
pages). There was no run time difference compared to an un-<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>ed
comparison table, in which all the HTML pages were cut down to 7 kB to fit.</P

pointers to <I

><P
>Indirect <ACRONYM

value stored somewhere in memory.  This case was originally created merely
as a proof of concept, but it is currently used during logical decoding to
avoid possibly having to create physical tuples exceeding 1 GB (as pulling
all out-of-line field values into the tuple might do).  The case is of
limited use since the creator of the pointer datum is entirely responsible
that the referenced data survives for as long as the pointer could exist,
and there is no infrastructure to help with this.</P
><P
>Expanded <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointers are useful for complex data types
whose on-disk representation is not especially suited for computational
purposes.  As an example, the standard varlena representation of a
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> array includes dimensionality information, a
nulls bitmap if there are any null elements, then the values of all the
elements in order.  When the element type itself is variable-length, the
only way to find the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>N</I
></TT
>'th element is to scan through all the
preceding elements.  This representation is appropriate for on-disk storage
because of its compactness, but for computations with the array it's much
nicer to have an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"expanded"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"deconstructed"</SPAN
>
representation in which all the element starting locations have been
identified.  The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer mechanism supports this need by
allowing a pass-by-reference Datum to point to either a standard varlena
value (the on-disk representation) or a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointer that
points to an expanded representation somewhere in memory.  The details of
this expanded representation are up to the data type, though it must have
a standard header and meet the other API requirements given
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/include/utils/expandeddatum.h</TT
>.  C-level functions
working with the data type can choose to handle either representation.
Functions that do not know about the expanded representation, but simply
apply <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM</CODE
> to their inputs, will automatically
receive the traditional varlena representation; so support for an expanded
representation can be introduced incrementally, one function at a time.</P
><P
><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> pointers to expanded values are further broken down
into <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>read-write</I
> and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>read-only</I
> pointers.
The pointed-to representation is the same either way, but a function that
receives a read-write pointer is allowed to modify the referenced value
in-place, whereas one that receives a read-only pointer must not; it must
first create a copy if it wants to make a modified version of the value.
This distinction and some associated conventions make it possible to avoid
unnecessary copying of expanded values during query execution.</P
