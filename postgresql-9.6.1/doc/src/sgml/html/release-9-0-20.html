>      Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)
     </P
><P
>      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue.

     </P
><P
>      Our replacement implementation of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>snprintf()</CODE
> failed to
      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </P
><P
>      It remains possible that some calls of the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>*printf()</CODE
>
      family of functions are vulnerable to information disclosure if an
      out-of-memory error occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk
      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check
      finally occurred, even if the row(s) the new row originally conflicted
      with had been deleted.

      written WAL due to HOT page pruning, leading to undesirable effects
      such as sessions getting stuck at startup if all synchronous replicas
      are down.  Sessions have also been observed to get stuck in catchup
      interrupt processing when using synchronous replication; this will fix
      that problem as well.

      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
> entries, which does not seem like a good
      thing to do in minor releases.)

><P
>      When sending large volumes of data, it's important to drain the input
      buffer every so often, in case the server has sent enough response data
      to cause it to block on output.  (A typical scenario is that the server
      is sending a stream of NOTICE messages during <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COPY FROM
      STDIN</TT
>.)  This worked properly in the normal blocking mode, but not
      so much in non-blocking mode.  We've modified <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
>
      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
      against this problem requires application cooperation: the application
      should watch for socket read-ready as well as write-ready conditions,
      and be sure to call <CODE
