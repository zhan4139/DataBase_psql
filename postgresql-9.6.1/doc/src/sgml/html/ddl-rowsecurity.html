>5.7. Row Security Policies</A
></H1
><P
>   In addition to the SQL-standard <A
HREF="ddl-priv.html"
>privilege
   system</A
> available through <A
HREF="sql-grant.html"
>GRANT</A
>,
   tables can have <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>row security policies</I
> that restrict,
   on a per-user basis, which rows can be returned by normal queries
   or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification commands.
   This feature is also known as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Row-Level Security</I
>.
   By default, tables do not have any policies, so that if a user has
   access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system,
   all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating.
  </P
><P
>   When row security is enabled on a table (with
   <A
HREF="sql-altertable.html"
>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL
   SECURITY</A
>), all normal access to the table for selecting rows or
   modifying rows must be allowed by a row security policy.  (However, the
   table's owner is typically not subject to row security policies.)  If no
   policy exists for the table, a default-deny policy is used, meaning that
   no rows are visible or can be modified.  Operations that apply to the
   whole table, such as <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>TRUNCATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>REFERENCES</TT
>,
   are not subject to row security.
  </P
><P
>   Row security policies can be specific to commands, or to roles, or to
   both.  A policy can be specified to apply to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALL</TT
>
   commands, or to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
>,
   or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DELETE</TT
>.  Multiple roles can be assigned to a given
   policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply.
  </P
><P
>   To specify which rows are visible or modifiable according to a policy,
   an expression is required that returns a Boolean result.  This
   expression will be evaluated for each row prior to any conditions or
   functions coming from the user's query.  (The only exceptions to this
   rule are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>leakproof</TT
> functions, which are guaranteed to
   not leak information; the optimizer may choose to apply such functions
   ahead of the row-security check.)  Rows for which the expression does
   not return <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
> will not be processed.  Separate expressions
   may be specified to provide independent control over the rows which are
   visible and the rows which are allowed to be modified.  Policy
   expressions are run as part of the query and with the privileges of the
   user running the query, although security-definer functions can be used
   to access data not available to the calling user.
  </P
><P
>   Superusers and roles with the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BYPASSRLS</TT
> attribute always
   bypass the row security system when accessing a table.  Table owners
   normally bypass row security as well, though a table owner can choose to
   be subject to row security with <A
HREF="sql-altertable.html"
>ALTER
   TABLE ... FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   Enabling and disabling row security, as well as adding policies to a
   table, is always the privilege of the table owner only.
  </P
><P
>   Policies are created using the <A
HREF="sql-createpolicy.html"
>CREATE POLICY</A
>
   command, altered using the <A
HREF="sql-alterpolicy.html"
>ALTER POLICY</A
> command,
   and dropped using the <A
HREF="sql-droppolicy.html"
>DROP POLICY</A
> command.  To
   enable and disable row security for a given table, use the
   <A
HREF="sql-altertable.html"
>ALTER TABLE</A
> command.
  </P
><P
>   Each policy has a name and multiple policies can be defined for a
   table.  As policies are table-specific, each policy for a table must
   have a unique name.  Different tables may have policies with the
   same name.
  </P
><P
>   When multiple policies apply to a given query, they are combined using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OR</TT
>, so that a row is accessible if any policy allows
   it.  This is similar to the rule that a given role has the privileges
   of all roles that they are a member of.
  </P
><P
>   As a simple example, here is how to create a policy on
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>account</TT
> relation to allow only members of
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>managers</TT
> role to access rows, and only rows of their
   accounts:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE accounts (manager text, company text, contact_email text);

ALTER TABLE accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY account_managers ON accounts TO managers
    USING (manager = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   If no role is specified, or the special user name
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> is used, then the policy applies to all
   users on the system.  To allow all users to access their own row in
   a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>users</TT
> table, a simple policy can be used:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE POLICY user_policy ON users
    USING (user_name = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   To use a different policy for rows that are being added to the table
   compared to those rows that are visible, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH CHECK</TT
>
   clause can be used.  This policy would allow all users to view all rows
   in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>users</TT
> table, but only modify their own:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE POLICY user_policy ON users
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (user_name = current_user);</PRE
><P
>   Row security can also be disabled with the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE</TT
>
   command.  Disabling row security does not remove any policies that are
   defined on the table; they are simply ignored.  Then all rows in the
   table are visible and modifiable, subject to the standard SQL privileges
   system.

   environments.  The table <TT

   disastrous if row security silently caused some rows to be omitted

   <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-ROW-SECURITY"

  </P

>   There are several ways around this problem.  One simple answer is to use
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   security policies.  However, that requires granting <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
>
   privilege on the referenced table (here <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>users</TT
>) to the
   affected users, which might be undesirable.  (But another row security
   policy could be applied to prevent them from actually exercising that
   privilege; or the sub-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> could be embedded into a security
   definer function.)  Also, heavy concurrent use of row share locks on the
   referenced table could pose a performance problem, especially if updates
   of it are frequent.  Another solution, practical if updates of the
   referenced table are infrequent, is to take an exclusive lock on the
   referenced table when updating it, so that no concurrent transactions
   could be examining old row values.  Or one could just wait for all
   concurrent transactions to end after committing an update of the
   referenced table and before making changes that rely on the new security
   situation.
