.SH "NAME"
CREATE_POLICY \- define a new row level security policy for a table
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
CREATE POLICY \fIname\fR ON \fItable_name\fR
    [ FOR { ALL | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE } ]
    [ TO { \fIrole_name\fR | PUBLIC | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, \&.\&.\&.] ]
    [ USING ( \fIusing_expression\fR ) ]
    [ WITH CHECK ( \fIcheck_expression\fR ) ]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBCREATE POLICY\fR
command defines a new row\-level security policy for a table\&. Note that row\-level security must be enabled on the table (using
\fBALTER TABLE \&.\&.\&. ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY\fR) in order for created policies to be applied\&.
.PP
A policy grants the permission to select, insert, update, or delete rows that match the relevant policy expression\&. Existing table rows are checked against the expression specified in
USING, while new rows that would be created via
INSERT
or
UPDATE
are checked against the expression specified in
WITH CHECK\&. When a
USING
expression returns true for a given row then that row is visible to the user, while if false or null is returned then the row is not visible\&. When a
WITH CHECK
expression returns true for a row then that row is inserted or updated, while if false or null is returned then an error occurs\&.
.PP
For
\fBINSERT\fR
and
\fBUPDATE\fR
statements,
WITH CHECK
expressions are enforced after
BEFORE
triggers are fired, and before any actual data modifications are made\&. Thus a
BEFORE ROW
trigger may modify the data to be inserted, affecting the result of the security policy check\&.
WITH CHECK
expressions are enforced before any other constraints\&.
.PP
Policy names are per\-table\&. Therefore, one policy name can be used for many different tables and have a definition for each table which is appropriate to that table\&.
.PP
Policies can be applied for specific commands or for specific roles\&. The default for newly created policies is that they apply for all commands and roles, unless otherwise specified\&. If multiple policies apply to a given statement, they will be combined using OR (although
ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
and
INSERT
policies are not combined in this way, but rather enforced as noted at each stage of
ON CONFLICT
execution)\&.
.PP
For commands that can have both
USING
and
WITH CHECK
policies (ALL
and
UPDATE), if no
WITH CHECK
policy is defined, then the
USING
policy will be used both for which rows are visible (normal
USING
case) and for which rows will be allowed to be added (WITH CHECK
case)\&.
.PP
If row\-level security is enabled for a table, but no applicable policies exist, a
\(lqdefault deny\(rq
policy is assumed, so that no rows will be visible or updatable\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIname\fR
.RS 4
The name of the policy to be created\&. This must be distinct from the name of any other policy for the table\&.
.RE
.PP
\fItable_name\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of the table the policy applies to\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIcommand\fR
.RS 4
The command to which the policy applies\&. Valid options are
\fBALL\fR,
\fBSELECT\fR,
\fBINSERT\fR,
\fBUPDATE\fR, and
\fBDELETE\fR\&.
\fBALL\fR
is the default\&. See below for specifics regarding how these are applied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIrole_name\fR
.RS 4
The role(s) to which the policy is to be applied\&. The default is
PUBLIC, which will apply the policy to all roles\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIusing_expression\fR
.RS 4
Any
SQL
conditional expression (returning
boolean)\&. The conditional expression cannot contain any aggregate or window functions\&. This expression will be added to queries that refer to the table if row level security is enabled\&. Rows for which the expression returns true will be visible\&. Any rows for which the expression returns false or null will not be visible to the user (in a
\fBSELECT\fR), and will not be available for modification (in an
\fBUPDATE\fR
or
\fBDELETE\fR)\&. Such rows are silently suppressed; no error is reported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIcheck_expression\fR
.RS 4
Any
SQL
conditional expression (returning
boolean)\&. The conditional expression cannot contain any aggregate or window functions\&. This expression will be used in
\fBINSERT\fR
and
\fBUPDATE\fR
queries against the table if row level security is enabled\&. Only rows for which the expression evaluates to true will be allowed\&. An error will be thrown if the expression evaluates to false or null for any of the records inserted or any of the records that result from the update\&. Note that the
\fIcheck_expression\fR
is evaluated against the proposed new contents of the row, not the original contents\&.
.RE
.SS "Per\-Command Policies"
.PP
ALL
.RS 4
Using
ALL
for a policy means that it will apply to all commands, regardless of the type of command\&. If an
ALL
policy exists and more specific policies exist, then both the
ALL
policy and the more specific policy (or policies) will be combined using OR, as usual for overlapping policies\&. Additionally,
ALL
policies will be applied to both the selection side of a query and the modification side, using the
USING
expression for both cases if only a
USING
expression has been defined\&.
.sp
As an example, if an
UPDATE
is issued, then the
ALL
policy will be applicable both to what the
UPDATE
will be able to select as rows to be updated (applying the
USING
expression), and to the resulting updated rows, to check if they are permitted to be added to the table (applying the
WITH CHECK
expression, if defined, and the
USING
expression otherwise)\&. If an
\fBINSERT\fR
or
\fBUPDATE\fR
command attempts to add rows to the table that do not pass the
ALL
policy\*(Aqs
WITH CHECK
expression, the entire command will be aborted\&.
.RE
.PP
SELECT
.RS 4
Using
SELECT
for a policy means that it will apply to
SELECT
queries and whenever
SELECT
permissions are required on the relation the policy is defined for\&. The result is that only those records from the relation that pass the
SELECT
policy will be returned during a
SELECT
query, and that queries that require
SELECT
permissions, such as
UPDATE, will also only see those records that are allowed by the
SELECT
policy\&. A
SELECT
policy cannot have a
WITH CHECK
expression, as it only applies in cases where records are being retrieved from the relation\&.
.RE
.PP
INSERT
.RS 4
Using
INSERT
for a policy means that it will apply to
INSERT
commands\&. Rows being inserted that do not pass this policy will result in a policy violation error, and the entire
INSERT
command will be aborted\&. An
INSERT
policy cannot have a
USING
expression, as it only applies in cases where records are being added to the relation\&.
.sp
Note that
INSERT
with
ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
checks
INSERT
policies\*(Aq
WITH CHECK
expressions only for rows appended to the relation by the
INSERT
path\&.
.RE
.PP
UPDATE
.RS 4
Using
UPDATE
for a policy means that it will apply to
UPDATE
commands (or auxiliary
ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
clauses of
INSERT
commands)\&. Since
UPDATE
involves pulling an existing record and then making changes to some portion (but possibly not all) of the record,
UPDATE
policies accept both a
USING
expression and a
WITH CHECK
expression\&. The
USING
expression determines which records the
UPDATE
command will see to operate against, while the
WITH CHECK
expression defines which modified rows are allowed to be stored back into the relation\&.
.sp
When an
UPDATE
command is used with a
WHERE
clause or a
RETURNING
clause,
SELECT
rights are also required on the relation being updated and the appropriate
SELECT
and
ALL
policies will be combined (using OR for any overlapping
SELECT
related policies found) with the
USING
clause of the
UPDATE
policy using AND\&. Therefore, in order for a user to be able to
UPDATE
specific rows, the user must have access to the row(s) through a
SELECT
or
ALL
policy and the row(s) must pass the
UPDATE
policy\*(Aqs
USING
expression\&.
.sp
Any rows whose updated values do not pass the
WITH CHECK
expression will cause an error, and the entire command will be aborted\&. If only a
USING
clause is specified, then that clause will be used for both
USING
and
WITH CHECK
cases\&.
.sp
Note, however, that
INSERT
with
ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
requires that an
UPDATE
policy
USING
expression always be enforced as a
WITH CHECK
expression\&. This
UPDATE
policy must always pass when the
UPDATE
path is taken\&. Any existing row that necessitates that the
UPDATE
path be taken must pass the (UPDATE
or
ALL)
USING
qualifications (combined using OR), which are always enforced as
WITH CHECK
options in this context\&. (The
UPDATE
path will
\fInever\fR
be silently avoided; an error will be thrown instead\&.) Finally, the final row appended to the relation must pass any
WITH CHECK
options that a conventional
UPDATE
is required to pass\&.
.RE
.PP
DELETE
.RS 4
Using
DELETE
for a policy means that it will apply to
DELETE
commands\&. Only rows that pass this policy will be seen by a
DELETE
command\&. There can be rows that are visible through a
SELECT
that are not available for deletion, if they do not pass the
USING
expression for the
DELETE
policy\&.
.sp
When a
DELETE
command is used with a
WHERE
clause or a
RETURNING
clause,
SELECT
rights are also required on the relation being updated and the appropriate
SELECT
and
ALL
policies will be combined (using OR for any overlapping
SELECT
related policies found) with the
USING
clause of the
DELETE
policy using AND\&. Therefore, in order for a user to be able to
DELETE
specific rows, the user must have access to the row(s) through a
SELECT
or
ALL
policy and the row(s) must pass the
DELETE
policy\*(Aqs
USING
expression\&.
.sp
A
DELETE
policy cannot have a
WITH CHECK
expression, as it only applies in cases where records are being deleted from the relation, so that there is no new row to check\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
You must be the owner of a table to create or change policies for it\&.
.PP
While policies will be applied for explicit queries against tables in the database, they are not applied when the system is performing internal referential integrity checks or validating constraints\&. This means there are indirect ways to determine that a given value exists\&. An example of this is attempting to insert a duplicate value into a column that is a primary key or has a unique constraint\&. If the insert fails then the user can infer that the value already exists\&. (This example assumes that the user is permitted by policy to insert records which they are not allowed to see\&.) Another example is where a user is allowed to insert into a table which references another, otherwise hidden table\&. Existence can be determined by the user inserting values into the referencing table, where success would indicate that the value exists in the referenced table\&. These issues can be addressed by carefully crafting policies to prevent users from being able to insert, delete, or update records at all which might possibly indicate a value they are not otherwise able to see, or by using generated values (e\&.g\&., surrogate keys) instead of keys with external meanings\&.
.PP
Generally, the system will enforce filter conditions imposed using security policies prior to qualifications that appear in user queries, in order to prevent inadvertent exposure of the protected data to user\-defined functions which might not be trustworthy\&. However, functions and operators marked by the system (or the system administrator) as
LEAKPROOF
may be evaluated before policy expressions, as they are assumed to be trustworthy\&.
.PP
Since policy expressions are added to the user\*(Aqs query directly, they will be run with the rights of the user running the overall query\&. Therefore, users who are using a given policy must be able to access any tables or functions referenced in the expression or they will simply receive a permission denied error when attempting to query the table that has row\-level security enabled\&. This does not change how views work, however\&. As with normal queries and views, permission checks and policies for the tables which are referenced by a view will use the view owner\*(Aqs rights and any policies which apply to the view owner\&.
.PP

Section 5.7, \(lqRow Security Policies\(rq, in the documentation\&.
